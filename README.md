# Daily Nutrition Calculator App

This project is a daily nutrition calculator app built using Clean Architecture, and a Multi-Modular design. The initial version of the project was created while following the Multi Module App course by Philipp Lackner. 

The app is entirely written in Kotlin and demonstrates the usage of various technologies and architectural principles, including:

- **Clean Architecture**: Implementing separation of concerns and maintainability through layers.
- **Multi-Modular Structure**: Organizing the project into multiple modules for better scalability and maintainability.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Utilizing the modern UI toolkit for building native Android UI.
- **Dependency Injection**: Leveraging Dagger/Hilt for dependency injection to ensure modularity and testability.
- **Concurrency**: Managing asynchronous operations efficiently.
- **Retrofit & OkHTTP**: Communicating with backend APIs.
- **Shared Preferences**: Storing small, simple data persistently.
- **Room Database**: Utilizing a SQLite object mapping library for local data storage.
- **Coil**: Loading images from URLs efficiently.

The project is a work in progress and will be continuously updated as new features are introduced.
